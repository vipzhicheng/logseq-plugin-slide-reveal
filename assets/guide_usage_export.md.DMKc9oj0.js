To implement this feature, it is first necessary to implement a print rendering mode.</p><h2 id="print-rendering-mode" tabindex="-1">Print Rendering Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#print-rendering-mode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Print Rendering Mode&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A setting for the rendering mode has been added to the settings page, with only two values available: normal and print. When set to print, the Slide Reveal plugin will display all the Slides tiled on a single page.</p><h2 id="enable-via-page-attributes" tabindex="-1">Enable via Page Attributes <a class="header-anchor" href="#enable-via-page-attributes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Enable via Page Attributes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you modify the configuration file, all Logseq pages will be affected. Therefore, I have also added a page attribute. Through this attribute, you can enable the print rendering mode for a single page.</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>data-page-view:: print</span></span></code></pre></div><blockquote><p>The flexibility of the Slide Reveal plugin lies in its support for various block attributes, and most block attributes can be configured at the page level, meaning they take effect on all Blocks within the page. Additionally, support for Tailwind CSS is integrated through the <code>data-class</code> attribute, enabling various beautification operations on the page.</p></blockquote><h2 id="manual-switching-within-the-slide-is-also-possible" tabindex="-1">Manual Switching within the Slide is Also Possible <a class="header-anchor" href="#manual-switching-within-the-slide-is-also-possible" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Manual Switching within the Slide is Also Possible&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you find it troublesome to write page attributes, you can manually switch the rendering mode within the Slide. In the Reveal mode, open the control panel in the lower left corner, where there is a menu item for switching the print mode. After clicking it, you can switch to the print rendering mode. Then, click the control panel in the lower left corner again, and you will notice that the menu has changed, with an additional menu item for exporting to PDF. Click it to start the export. Here, the export is implemented using the function of converting print to PDF based on the browser kernel.</p><p>After the export is completed, you can open it to check the effect. If you are satisfied, you can click the control panel in the lower left corner again to switch back to the Reveal mode. If you are not satisfied, you may need to adjust the content or the print size. When I exported on a 1920x1080 screen, the size I used was 223 mm x 397 mm.</p><h2 id="shortcut-keys" tabindex="-1">Shortcut Keys <a class="header-anchor" href="#shortcut-keys" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Shortcut Keys&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Whether it is to switch the rendering mode or trigger the export pop-up window, there are shortcuts, which are <code>p</code> and <code>cmd+p</code> respectively.</p><h2 id="frequently-asked-questions" tabindex="-1">Frequently Asked Questions <a class="header-anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="_1-why-is-there-no-vertical-scrollbar" tabindex="-1">1.
