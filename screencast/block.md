# Block-Level Slides

Sometimes, your Logseq page contains a lot of content, and you only want a portion of it to represent your slide presentation. In this case, you may want to start from a specific Block, with its child nodes forming the slides you wish to present. Simply use the `/Slide Reveal` command or the `Slide Reveal` option in the Block context menu to open the slide presentation. Additionally, you may see the `Slide Preview` command, which allows you to preview any individual slide. This can be particularly useful when crafting your presentation.
