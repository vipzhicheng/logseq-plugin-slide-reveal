# Tailwind CSS

The `Slide Reveal` plugin comes with a wide range of `Tailwind CSS` classes pre-built for users to utilize directly. Note that each class here begins with an exclamation mark `!` to ensure that the applied classes have higher priority.

## Demo

What effects can be achieved through Tailwind CSS here depends on your understanding of Tailwind CSS. The demo video showcases gradients for text, text icons, and element animations, all implemented using Tailwind CSS.
