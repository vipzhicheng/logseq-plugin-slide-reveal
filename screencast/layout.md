# Layout

By inspecting the rendered code, you can see that each slide is placed within a `<section>` element, which has a style of `display: flex` hardcoded. If you are familiar with CSS, this means you can achieve flexible layouts based on `flex` display.

## Demo

Here, we provide a simple example that also utilizes built-in styles from `TailwindCSS`.
