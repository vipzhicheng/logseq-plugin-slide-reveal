# Themes

The plugin supports theme configuration, and in addition to specifying particular theme names, it also offers the option to choose a random theme, a random theme for each slide, and inheritance of themes. By utilizing the `data-theme` attribute in the documentation, you can easily achieve more flexible theme switching.
