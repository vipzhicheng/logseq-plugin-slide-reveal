# Quick Start

Welcome to the Logseq Slide Reveal. This is a simple guide to help you quickly understand and start using it.

## What It Is

Logseq Slide Reveal is a Logseq plugin that allows you to create Reveal.js-based slides within Logseq. Unlike Logseq's built-in slide solution, not every Block is converted into a slide page, but rather each top-level Block and its first-level Blocks together form a single slide.

Additionally, the principle of making slides with this plugin is that you design the slides you need where you need them, rather than converting every page you've previously written into slides.

## Features

- Each slide page is formed by each top-level Block and its first-level Blocks.
- The plugin provides some Block properties to control the style of slides.
- Supports setting slide themes.
- Supports setting slide transition effects.
- Supports drawing with a pen.
- Supports shortcut keys.
- Supports zooming.
- Supports vertical navigation of slides.
- Supports converting only the child elements of a certain Block into slides.
- Supports previewing individual slide nodes.
- And more.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new page and, as usual, add your first Block:

```

2. There is a slide icon in the top right corner of the page; click it, and you can view your slides.

3. That's it, you've made your first slide.

4. Next, you can add more Blocks to the page, and then click the slide icon in the top right corner to view your slides. You may need to read more documentation to learn how to make your slides even cooler.
