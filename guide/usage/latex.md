# Latex

Latex support four syntaxes:

1. Enclose with `$$` at both ends
2. Enclose with `$` at both ends
3. Enclose with `\\(...\\)` at both ends
4. Enclose with `\\[...\\]` at both ends

The first two are more commonly used because they are consistent with Logseq's latex syntax.

## Examples

```
- # Latex Demo 1
	- $$ J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \sum_{i=0}  $$
```
